Our project aims to digitalize the selling of products for small craftsmen and artisans who do not have any knowledge about the online world. These people are struggling to sell their products because of the advent of online shopping platforms. The project will help them upscale their business and reach a broader customer segment who want to buy handmade or local goods but cannot find them online.
Existing tech giants require sellers to know the platform, so we intend to focus on those who cannot use the sites to sell their goods online by working closely with them and selling their products on our platform. 
With our project, we aim to promote the use of local and handmade goods by making them convenient to both buy and sell.
